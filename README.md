MySQL: As the relational database management system to store user and blog-related data.

Hibernate: For object-relational mapping between Java entities and the MySQL database.

Swagger: For API documentation and testing.

Maven: As the build tool to manage dependencies and run tasks.

Post: Contains task information, including title, content, and user author.
Task: Stores Task name, task date along with the user who made the task.
AuthenticationToken: Manages user authentication tokens.
3. Model / Entity(User, Task, Admin, AuthenticationToken):-
Annotation Used :- @Data, @NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor, @Id, @OneToOne, @Column, @JoinColumn, @Entity, @GeneratedValue, @Enumerated, @NotBlank, @Min, @Max, @ManyToMany, @ManyToOne, @JoinTable, @JsonProperty, @NotNull, @Column, @Validated, @Pattern
Data Structure used in my Project
Used :- SQL Database --> But Mostly used Java Concept, oops, collection, ENUM
Security
Authentication is implemented using an Authentication Token class. This token is generated upon successful sign-in and must be included in the headers of subsequent requests to authorized endpoints.

Encryption
Authentication is implemented using an Authentication Token class. This token is generated upon successful sign-in and must be included in the headers of subsequent requests to authorized endpoints.

Project Summary
Aim :- This is basically good project for learning purpose springBoot basics, Mappings, Annotation, API, spring mvc and CRUD Operation, swagger, crud Repository inbuilt method, and Custom Finder and Custom Query. In this project i just add Posts, get all psots a particular user, update User inforamtion lot of things i learned from this project.
